- :rocket: I have learned coding on my own and build web applications with ```Python/Django```
- :purple_heart: I am a persistant learner and constantly looking for new challenges
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web projects and a first web developer job
- 📫 How to reach me: email me [this.jiyun@gmail.com]
